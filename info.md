##### This Project & Credits
This is a tool/guide to help with negotiations in Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal.

There are distinct negotiation differences between the original and Royal version. Some Shadow have different personalities/arcana/weaknesses, questions and answers are worded differently, and reactions to answers have changed as well.

Please note that at this time, the guide is a work-in-progress, so it is missing reactions and could have mistakes.

If you want to help, contribute, report mistakes, or confirm some results, please use the <a href="https://github.com/joyce-chen/persona5-negotiation/issues/16">open issue on Github for P5 Royal</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/joyce-chen/persona5-negotiation/issues/17">open issue for P5</a>, or the <a href="https://forms.gle/LYeRcRsMgnYYu85A8">Google Form</a>. 

Submitted questions are up-to-date as of **March 13 2023**. (No consistent update schedule. Happy New Year 🎉)

##### How to Use

Each of the negotiation question pages has a search bar that can filter by question or answer. 

Next to the search bar is a switch to change the "GOOD", "OK", and "BAD" reactions to symbols for people who find emojis more useful.

Underneath, there is a filter questions by Shadows collapsable card with Shadow tags. Currently it is a work-in-progress feature. It displays the confirmed questions asked by the specified Shadow. 

**Negotiation Table Legend:**
- White Background: Either sent in or are from my playthrough, so are more likely to be correct.
- <span class="unconfirmed">Pink Background</span>: Unconfirmed.
- Have a dash (-): Lacking data.

##### Shadows
The Shadows will initially have a title or description, but once you've captured it, its Persona name will be revealed. A list of the Shadows you'll encounter by area can be viewed on the <a href="shadows">P5 SHADOWS page</a>. The Royal version can be viewed on the <a href="shadows_royal">ROYAL SHADOWS page</a>.

##### Hold Up and Talk
If all enemies in the battle are knocked down by being hit with attacks they are weak to, a "Hold Up" is triggered. If you choose to "Talk" and say "Lend me your power", you can start negotiating with a Shadow. 

If the Shadow is a higher level than Joker, you'll get an item instead. If you currently have the same Persona in your party, it will grant EXP to your own Persona.

##### Personalities
Negotiations are dependent on the Shadow's personality. There are four types of personality: **Gloomy**, **Irritable**, **Timid**, and **Upbeat**. Most other guides feature the following table to help with negotiations, but sometimes it's difficult to distinquish which answers are "vague", "serious", "kind", or "funny".

| Type      | Likes   | Dislikes        |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Gloomy    | Vague   | Serious, Funny  |
| Irritable | Serious | Vague, Kind     |
| Timid     | Kind    | Vague, Funny    |
| Upbeat    | Funny   | Serious, Vague  |

##### Responses
During negotiations, a Shadow will ask you two questions. For each, you're given three responses to choose from. Depending on which answer you choose, the Shadow will react in the following ways:

- **Good:** Marked by golden musical notes 🎶. This is always the best answer. If you get this for the second question, you will obtain the Shadow as a new Persona.

- **OK:** Marked by light blue sweat marks 💦. When you answer the second question with the OK option, you will most likely end the negotiation with an item as a reward. The Persona will then flee after giving the item. However, there is a very small chance, that the Shadow will join you with an OK answer.

- **Bad:** Marked by red angry vein marks 💢. It is okay to get a bad answer for the first question. However, if you get a bad answer for the second question you will fail the negotiation and the monster will either run away or you’ll have to fight it again. Once you have a party member hit around level 3 - 4 as a confidant, your characters will be able to potentially step in and save a negotiation should things go south. This ability will usually give you a second chance at negotiating with the Shadow.
