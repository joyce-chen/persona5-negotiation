##### Shadows
The Shadows will initially have a title or description, but once you've has captured it, its title will turn into its Persona name. A list of the Shadows you'll encounter by area can be viewed on the <a href="shadows">SHADOWS page</a>.

##### Personalities
Negotiations are dependent on the Shadow's personality. There are four types of personality: **Gloomy**, **Irritable**, **Timid**, and **Upbeat**. Most other guides feature the following table to help with negotiations, but sometimes it's difficult to distinquish which answers are "vague", "serious", "kind", or "funny".

| Type      |  Likes  | Dislikes        |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Gloomy    | Vague   | Serious, Funny  |
| Irritable | Serious | Vague, Kind     |
| Timid     | Kind    | Vague, Funny    |
| Upbeat    | Funny   | Serious, Vague  |

##### Responses
During negotiations, a Shadow will ask you two questions. For each, you're given three responses to chopse from. Depending on which answer you choose, the Shadow will react in the following ways:

- **Good:** Marked by golden musical notes 🎶. This is always the best answer. If you get this for the second question, you will obtain the Shadow as a new Persona.

- **OK:** Marked by light blue sweat marks 💦. When you answer the second question with the OK option, you will most likely end the negotiation with an item as a reward. The Persona will then flee after giving the item. However, there is a very small chance, that the Shadow will join you with an OK answer.

- **Bad:** Marked by red angry vein marks 💢. It is okay to get a bad answer for the first question. However, if you get a bad answer for the second question you will fail the negotiation and the monster will either run away or you’ll have to fight it again. Once you have a party member hit around level 3 - 4 as a confidant, your characters will be able to potentially step in and save a negotiation should things go south. This ability will usually give you a second chance at negotiating with the Shadow.
